    <h1>The full description of the video</h1>
    <p>Laura opens the zoom meeting and starts speaking:</p>
    <p>Okay, I would like to say to you that, you know, Kiesha, when we met, we met Kiesha probably, I would say two years ago, would it be right, Kiesha? Unmute yourself, good. About two years ago, I think. And, um, yeah, we had a, yeah, we had a, I don't, I hope she won't mind me sharing this. </p>
    <p>We had a massive deliverance happening and, and she has been really suffering a lot with all sorts of things. And it's been very difficult journey, but you know, one thing about Kiesha is that Kiesha is a warrior. She is like bulldozer.</p>
    <p>She goes, she knows where she's heading and she's going to get there and nothing and no one in terms of the spiritual negative, spiritual realm will stop her. And I love it about her. And there are moments where she, you know, when I'm sort of not quite sure what's what's what and whatever.</p>
    <p>And I know I can like pick up the phone and say, Kiesha, I need some insight here. And it's amazing to have people around you who, who have that sort of on them. So Kiesha, we just want to bless the gift that God has given you. </p>
    <p>We want to thank him for the journey that you've been on and that, you know, it's so beautiful to see you really stepping out and stepping in the wholeness and fullness of what he has for you. And we are so grateful that you will be able to speak today. And we just, yeah, we bless you a lot for everything you have done.</p>
    <p>Kiesha, it's all yours.</p>
    <p>Kisha takes over and starts her teaching:</p>
    <p>Thank you so much. Can you hear me? Well, is it okay? Okay.</p>
    <p>Okay. So I just want to honor Mark and Laura, obviously, thank you so much for this opportunity. And also Daniel and Heather Adams for their ministry, obviously.</p>
    <p>I need to icebreaker. So I have to give some humor. Oh my gosh, you put me on full screen. </p>
    <p>Let me get myself. Okay, that was scary. Don't do that.</p>
    <p>Yeah. So yeah, no, icebreaker. So I was talking to my apostle yesterday. </p>
    <p>I was talking about Laura, but I was also speaking to my apostle. And I said, this is the first time I'll be doing this. And I've changed the notes three times. </p>
    <p>Well, I've been led by the spirit three times. I'm like, why does it keep changing? I don't understand. And he was like, oh, yes, that's what happens.</p>
    <p>Because what you need to be concerned about, like I said, concerned, because if it switches on the spot, as you're talking, and I'm sure Laura had that experience just recently. Definitely. And she had to think on the fly by the Holy Spirit. </p>
    <p>And that takes a lot of faith, you know, to do. I'm sorry, my cat is acting up. So yeah. </p>
    <p>So just briefly, I want to also say that I'm a student of prophecy. I'm still learning. I'm one year in that understanding. </p>
    <p>But I'm a seer, as in born seer, my whole life. So I understand dreams and visions and that kind of thing. But it's when it all gets tied together into one, you know, and starts making sense.</p>
    <p>So yeah, I want to give thanks to the people that have started to train me, GPA and all that kind of stuff. Emma Stark, Jennifer Leclerc, Apostle Andre, and Laura as well, because Laura trains as well, in an interesting way as well. So yeah, so glory to God. </p>
    <p>I pray right now, Lord, that the Holy Spirit will lead and flow through me. And that you will minister to us, Lord God, and bring understanding and revelation, and let your will be done in Jesus name. Amen. </p>
    <p>Okay, so this is a prophetic crash course, okay? Because it all flooded. And I had to make sense of it. So okay, here is my notes so far, right? So it says, what is a prophet? And a prophetic person is the things that we'll be discussing, who the prophetic is for, how to hear from God, when is it God, and then we'll be doing an exercise later on. </p>
    <p>Don't run now that I said that. Because there's gonna be some training. At the end, I'll be praying for the Lord to bring the gift of prophecy on everyone. </p>
    <p>And then you'll be training on it. So yeah, don't you know, just, it's okay, it's all good. So okay, what is prophecy? Prophecy is revelation from God.</p>
    <p>It can be past tense, present or future. And revelation is revealing the heart of Jesus Christ in your life. And so when we receive Christ, we receive revelation of who he is.</p>
    <p>And we've accepted his testimony, and his prophecy as Jesus, and his return. So that's how you get the spirit of prophecy. It's in Revelations 1910, when John met with an angel. </p>
    <p>And he knelt down, you know, to go and bow to the angel's feet. And the angel said, Do not worship me, I'm a servant like you are. And he said, this is a pinpoint area, worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is in the spirit of prophecy. </p>
    <p>So that's throughout the whole Bible, from beginning to end, there's prophecy. And there's an unfolding of, you know, Old Testament prophecy is that Jesus is coming. And then in New Testament, it would be that he's coming again, to get his bride, right.</p>
    <p>So the testimony of testimony of Jesus is a spirit of testimony in itself. Okay, so what is a prophet? So most of you already know that a prophet is sort of marked as a New Testament prophet is marked in Ephesians four under the fivefold ministry. Can I send over my notes? I knew someone was gonna say that.</p>
    <p>Yeah, I'll send over the notes. I can't keep up with my speed. Am I going too fast? Okay. </p>
    <p>All right. So I'll slow down slightly. So a prophet is a fivefold ministry.</p>
    <p>If it's in the gifts of the fivefold ministry, apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor and teacher. And it's in New Testament, we have an Old Testament prophet. And you know, the ones that we all know, Daniel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, but then you have New Testament prophets, and they have obviously under the new covenant under Jesus Christ. </p>
    <p>And so going into that a prophet holds the role or the office of the prophets. So it means that they hold, it's basically the job, it's their position within the church. And they have a mantle, you would have heard it said differently, the mantle, the assignment, the call, it basically just means the covering, God has appointed them for that role. </p>
    <p>And then there's the covering of God on them for that role, right? What do they do? They receive revelation from God and speak on behalf of God, Old and New Testament. And you'll find also that I want to just briefly just touch on something I wasn't going to, but I will. There's prophecy with a C, which means future tense. </p>
    <p>It's about future prophecies. And you'll find those in the Bible, you'll find them in revelations, especially those to come in the end times. And then there's prophecy with an S and prophecy with an S is how we will be prophesying later on tonight, which is just you flow in the spirit from the word of God, which is the Logos word into the Rhema word. </p>
    <p>Okay. I don't want to get too technical, but that's what it is. Okay. </p>
    <p>And so, yeah, so a prophet, I want to just say what a prophet is not. If they're not just there to see the future, they're not just there to do that because they're not psychics. We're not there to go, Oh, I see in the crystal ball, I see your future and it's going to be there. </p>
    <p>So I see it's going to be that it's, that's not the point of it. It's to give glory back to God. It has to be about giving glory back to God.</p>
    <p>And it's not about also just flying off left, right and center prophetic words either. I mean, most of the important prophetic words that you will receive stick with you for most of your lifetime, you know, cause it just weighs on your spirit. And those kinds of words are the words that you really truly want to release, you know, but we do believe in obviously encouraging people through prophecy. </p>
    <p>So it says here that I've got in my next line. So yeah, the main role is to equip the church and make the church aware of God's plan and to train up the people in the church for what God is doing. But they also are called to watch and pray and to tear down Satan's plans. </p>
    <p>Anything that he builds up, they tear down. They tell them Satan's plans to build up what God wants and to speak to the nations. And so I hope I'm going at a good pace guys.</p>
    <p>Okay, good. You can also find prophets. This is, I don't know, a lot of churches don't teach this because it's usually a pastor teaching about a prophet. </p>
    <p>And so they won't have that level of understanding about that particular role. I'll get into what a watchman is as well, Paul. Yeah, so they won't have that understanding about the characteristics of a prophet, what their real assignment is. </p>
    <p>And there's been a bit of disputes between the prophets and the pastors in the past. And now they're finally realizing that they all need each other. And we all need to join together, because we're all the different body parts in Christ. </p>
    <p>And we need to come together, learn to get along, learn to navigate situations. That's extremely important. So this is kind of the season we're going into.</p>
    <p>We're going into the season of fullness in Christ. And I will speak later about what that fullness in Christ is. That's extremely important. </p>
    <p>If we want to lead with love, we also need to, we want to and should desire to have the fullness of Christ in us, in everything we do, above our gifts, above how we look and sound. So I got back to my point about some reason why some pastors don't know what the roles of a prophet is, is because you can actually get prophets assigned to the marketplace, which means a secular industry. And their role would be, I'll give an example from the Bible. </p>
    <p>Daniel was the advisor to Nebuchadnezzar, who was the king of Babylon. And if you guys know what Babylon is, Babylon is the worst of the worst, right? And so that industry would be political, governmental, and to the nations. So it kind of ties it all in together. </p>
    <p>And so that's how you get, okay, I'll give my notes, don't worry. That's how you get, yeah, a prophet that's marketplace prophet. So what's the characteristics of a prophet? I will get into a prophetic person, which is different, but this is just what a role of a prophet is. </p>
    <p>And whether you, maybe you're wondering yourself, am I a prophet? You will know by these characteristics. Now it's going to sound, as I was writing it, the characteristics don't sound so great. But when you realize that a prophet is there to stir people up in the spirit and to get movement and to agitate, you will understand why they behave the way they do. </p>
    <p>Okay. So a prophet usually goes through a lot of testing in their life. One of the testings that they usually have is rejection. </p>
    <p>And that's heavy rejection. This is over and over again. It's not usually just once, it's multiple times. </p>
    <p>And it's to build character. And it's for you to build your trust in God. And it's the refiner's fire, you know, where God is seeing if you're up to par. </p>
    <p>He's, he's, he's wanting to see if you will pick up your cross, if you'll die to self and pick up a cross. And a prophet has to go through that rejection period. I don't know any prophet that hasn't gone through that rejection period. </p>
    <p>It's just something that has to happen. A prophet can be seen as very odd, very odd, or extreme. That's when they're a bit, you know, you're not sure if they're all there, they're a bit nutty. </p>
    <p>And then they have a strong character. So they're extremely assertive. But they might not know how to communicate with people properly. </p>
    <p>You know, this is again, where they have a strength, but it needs to be developed so that they can be able to communicate with people, be able to deliver the word of God effectively, and to see change, you know, because otherwise, you just have people uptight, not wanting to listen to you. And then this is where it gets even more extreme that so they're bold, they're confrontational, but they're confrontational to sin. Remember, they have to hate sin, the same amount as God hates sin. </p>
    <p>So you will see them confront the sin, not you, they don't hate you, they're confronting the sin that needs to be gone. And we obviously know that in deliverance ministry, we confront demons all the time. So that's we're confronting what would cause the sin or open the door to sin, you know, that kind of thing. </p>
    <p>So we deal with that all the time here. And so I've also already mentioned that they irritate, they irritate in the spirit, because they're, they're calling for repentance, they're calling for prayer, they're calling for change, and they're calling, calling for building up in God. Right? So they're irritating, in the nicest, nicest, nicest possible way. </p>
    <p>I'm talking about myself as well. I already know that that's that can be the case. But it's true. </p>
    <p>You haven't, you haven't lived with me 24 hours a day. So yeah, a side note, if you ever feel like if you feel you are a prophet, there's obviously the hurdles that I said rejection that you face, you just will have to go to go for it. But there's also on top of that an imposter syndrome, where you're either in complete denial about who you are, or you feel you're not good enough for that position, right? And then the other spirit, or I wouldn't say imposter syndrome is a spirit, but the spirit that we're in that I'm going to talk about now is an orphan spirit, where you feel like you're without a father, you're without someone to call on, or, you know, without family members, and you feel alone.</p>
    <p>And that's recorded, where I can't remember which prophet is, but they were like, Oh, I'm alone, I'm all by myself, there's no one else. It's just me, right? And God was like, it's not just you, there is others, you may not see them with right in front of you, but there are others around, you know. So it's important to know, Elijah, thank you. </p>
    <p>Yes, Elijah, that's it. And so where So it's important, this is an important part, once a prophet knows that they're a prophet, which is only just happened for me, like last year, or whenever it was, that was the proper confirmation for me, I kind of knew, but I didn't know for sure. And so you just don't really want to go into that territory until you know for sure. </p>
    <p>Once they know, a prophet should find accountability wherever they can. And they usually find that in the school of prophets. And you'll find a couple of groups that are well known for that. </p>
    <p>And if you can't find that kind of support system, then you it would be best for you to go to your church and find, you know, accountability or support there, you know. And my last point for that, about a prophet is that a prophet must remember to lead with love as their foundation must remember, and I believe there's a cleansing going on, and other prophets have spoken about this, there's a cleansing going on about how to be pure, have a fasting life, and also to lead with love as your first point. And I'm going to quote a scripture that kind of hits it pretty hard as to why it's so important to have love. </p>
    <p>It's 1 Corinthians 13, one to two. And it says, if I speak in tongues of men, and of angels and have no love, I am a noisy gong and clanging cymbal. And then it says, if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have no love, I have nothing. </p>
    <p>So that's how intense it is. That's how heavy it is that God says, yes, you have all those gifts. Yes, you have, you know, your talents and different things that you do. </p>
    <p>But if you have no love, your prophetic word or who you are in within the body of Christ is nothing. And so I've left the side note here, I said the prophetic word without love kills, just like the letter when it says in the Bible, it kills when it's without the love of Christ. And that's something really important to get. </p>
    <p>And if you're testing a prophetic word, and you feel like you've received the word, or you've given a word where you've, I'm going to go into rebuking, I'm going to speak about rebuking warnings and wrath of God. But if you feel that there was no love in that, and you've taken it to God, and you feel there's no love in that message, dismiss it. Do not keep it dismiss it. </p>
    <p>Because the source of that, that word has come from another spirit and not from God. Okay. Alright, so it's next bit is why are prophets important? I've kind of covered that. </p>
    <p>But like I said, they bring repentance, prayer change, but they're also proactive in seeking out revelation, they don't sit and wait to receive, they go after revelation. So you'll find that they have a very weird schedule, they will just be sitting in the presence of the Lord, waiting to hear from the Lord, waiting for that clue where they see something, hear something, know something, they're on constant watch, right for to hear from the Lord. And yeah, they also have spiritual insight and discernment for the seasons ahead, seeing God's plans and the enemy's tactics. </p>
    <p>So I'm going to quote one scripture here, Amos 3.7, for the Lord God does nothing without revealing his secret to his servants, the prophets. And that scripture basically means God gives revelation to his prophets first, because he's trying to ready the church for whatever the next move is. And those with prophetic gifting, they can also tap into that.</p>
    <p>You can also receive that word, especially if you're engaging with the Holy Spirit, you have a relationship with Jesus Christ, you should be able to catch on to it, you're of the same, it's the same spirit. It's all Holy Spirit, right? So that's important to know. So don't feel like you're separate from the prophets, that you can't receive a word by yourself. </p>
    <p>It's important to receive words from God. You should actually keep probably a journal and begin to write down what God is saying to you. Yeah, go after revelation, exactly. </p>
    <p>Go after revelation. Okay, I'll answer that bit about prophecy. No, I did actually answer that. </p>
    <p>Prophecy with a C is definitely future tense. Prophecy with an S is definitely you prophesying through scripture. So I'll just clarify that again. </p>
    <p>Prophecy with a C is future tense. Prophecy with an S is you're looking at the Bible, you believe you have a word, something's highlighted in the scripture, you believe you have a word for someone, and then you release that word over someone's life, okay? That caught me off when I heard that. I thought, why are they complicating things? One letter, I keep missing the S and the C all the time. </p>
    <p>So why do you have to keep doing that? But anyway, it's important to know, but it's not the most important. As long as you understand that there is a spirit and gift of prophecy, and you operate in that through the Holy Spirit, and you understand how to discern through, which I'll go through the discernment of prophetic words, you're on the right track. We don't need to overcomplicate things, you know? All right, so just because I am considered a seer and not a prophet, I have given a difference between a prophet and a seer, and it's basically based on how they receive revelation. </p>
    <p>So let me just drink some water for a second. Oh my gosh. Okay, so a prophet usually hears, you know? So I know that you guys, I'm sure that you guys understand what I say when I say to you, seeing in the spirit, hearing in the spirit, knowing in the spirit. </p>
    <p>You just have a knowing about something or feeling or knowing, yeah? Okay, so a prophet hears from God through words, right? And the Hebrew word for that is a nabi. That's what it means. And that particular Hebrew word means a bubbling up from the belly.</p>
    <p>So they just get it. It's like a rush that goes from the belly. And sometimes they don't even know what they're saying. </p>
    <p>It hits their mouth and the word of God just matches in that moment, and they begin to flow in that stream. My mom is that, and I call those ones that talk a lot. She's not going to like that I said that, but I say that to her anyway. </p>
    <p>They talk a lot. And then you have this seer, which is what I am, which is called a rohe, so R-O comma E-H. And it means they see or perceive in the spirit first. </p>
    <p>That's the leaning, right? So it's usually envisions, so it's pictures, movies, words in block before you. And then they say what they see, right? So a seer is not usually comfortable with prophesying over people. It's not their default. </p>
    <p>They're used to receiving words from dreams and visions. Then they process it, then they release it. Whereas a nabi prophet, someone who uses their words releases it on the spot, right? And from all the prophets that I've checked, about five prophets I check for reference, and they all say the same thing. </p>
    <p>A prophet that flows in the spirit just by words, their common mistake is that they don't have grace in the way that they're speaking. So it can come across quite harsh when they're speaking. And that's why you can still have love when you're speaking. </p>
    <p>But if you use certain words that are harsh, it can be slightly off, you know, when you're receiving it, you're not sure, am I, is this from God or is this not from God, you know? It's because they're just, they're churning out what they hear in the spirit, and they're having their own interpretation of it as it's coming out. Whereas a seer will get a vision, which is the picture, for example, we could take, I know, I think it's Marina, she has flowers, pictures of flowers often, because of gardening. I think it's, I think it's you that has it. </p>
    <p>Now, I know absolutely nothing about gardening and flowers. So if God showed me different tulips and different flowers, I'd be like, I don't know what's going on, I don't know why you're showing me this, because it doesn't relate to me. But God will show you images that make sense to you. </p>
    <p>But then you're speaking to someone else, so you have to convert it. And that's the interpretation. So now you're converting the words for it to make sense to the person. </p>
    <p>That's why you need to practice your gift. Because how you deliver the word is also important, as you know, some people like to flex, oh, I saw this in the spirit, I saw that in the spirit. And then they don't say what it is, or they don't give instruction. </p>
    <p>And then everyone goes, okay, that's great. Like, what are we meant to do with that? We can't do anything with it. So a seer must perfect converting the vision out to the person that they're speaking to.</p>
    <p>And an Abbey prophet must learn to tame their words, basically, that's the best way of saying it. Okay, so a seer also taps into the other spiritual senses. So they go into a range of senses, basically. </p>
    <p>So they see, they hear, they sense, they touch and feel. I know that for a fact that I've had that recently, they discern, like most of us do, they also have smell, and taste. And when I was saying earlier to you that we're going into a time where we're going to experience the fullness of God, well, there's been two or three prophets, probably a bit more than that, that have released the word saying that this seer anointing is what we will be going into, because it's more of a wholeness of experiencing having encounters with God.</p>
    <p>And I'm going to give an example. So remember Moses, with the bush, with the burning bush, that was a whole experience. That was right in front of him. </p>
    <p>He walked into the space, he had to take off his shoes, we're going into the touch of, you know, the field, he's on the sand, or whatever, whatever he's on, the sand is probably going in his face, you know, there's all kinds of things going on. He's hearing the voice coming from the bush. He's seeing, he's sensing, he's probably going, what on earth is going on? I've never seen anything like this before. </p>
    <p>You know, so it's everything kicking off at once. And that's, I wouldn't say it's a true encounter, there's many different types of encounters. But that's what we're going into. </p>
    <p>That's exciting, right? I'm going to give one other word, I think I put later down, but I'm going to say it now. Think of Peter, when he was at the gate, and they thought that he was still in prison. And he's knocking at the gates, you know, let me in. </p>
    <p>And they're thinking, oh, it's his angel. They didn't even realise it was him. So it was so normal, back then in the days of Noah, and you know, Genesis period, which remember, it says in Revelations, we will go back through the days of Noah, which means we will have angels walking the earth, we'll see, have encounters. </p>
    <p>Yes, we will probably see demons too, but we'll see angels too, you know, we're going to have that experiential encounter with God. And so my point is, is that it was so normal for them to see angels, just as much as they could see people. And that's the place that we're going to be going into.</p>
    <p>And that's technically the seer anointing, that all those senses activated at once. And so I just want to leave with the last point is that seers were the original name for prophets. Because of the encounters, because of the full senses.</p>
    <p>So all seers are prophets, but not all prophets are seers. And that's from 1 Samuel 9, 9, where it says formally in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, come, let us go to the seer, because the prophet of today used to be called seer, okay. So now we're going to go into the stuff that's for everyone, which is the prophetic, the prophetic people, which is all of us. </p>
    <p>And now I'm hot, one minute, let me take off my top. So good news is that, and the good news in the gospels in Christ, is that we can all prophesy, we can all ask for the gift, and we can all operate in that gifting, and we can all exercise that gift in Christ. You must do it through the Holy Spirit, don't do it through any other spirit.</p>
